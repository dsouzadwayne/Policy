  Course Transcript Extractor is a Chrome extension that extracts video lecture transcripts from Coursera
  and Udemy course pages and saves them as local text files. It operates entirely within your browser.

  Data Collection

  This extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or user information.

  What the Extension Accesses

  - Page content on Coursera and Udemy only: The extension reads DOM elements (course names, lecture
  titles, and transcript text) solely to compile transcripts.
  - Local storage: Used only to maintain extraction progress within your browser session.
  - Downloads: Used only to save the compiled transcript file to your local device.

  All processing happens locally in your browser. No data is sent to any external server, analytics
  service, or third party.

  Third-Party Services

  This extension does not use any third-party services, tracking, or analytics.

  Permissions

  - activeTab: To read transcript content from the current Coursera or Udemy tab.
  - storage: To persist extraction progress between popup sessions.
  - downloads: To save the output file locally.
  - Host permissions (coursera.org, udemy.com): To inject content scripts that read course and transcript
  data.
