  Info ("the extension") is a Chrome browser extension that extracts biographical data from web pages and 
  copies page text from browser tabs. This privacy policy explains what data the extension accesses, how
  it is used, and how it is stored.

  Data Collection

  The extension does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data. No information is sent to any
  external server, third-party service, or analytics platform. The extension has no backend, no accounts,
  and no telemetry.

  Data Access

  When you choose to extract data from a tab, the extension reads the text content of that page in order
  to identify names, dates, locations, and other biographical fields. This processing happens entirely
  within your browser. Page content is never stored beyond the duration of the extraction operation and is
   discarded as soon as results are displayed.

  Data Storage

  The extension stores the following data locally on your device using Chrome's built-in storage APIs:

  - User preferences — column order, enabled columns, extraction settings, and AI feature toggle. These
  are stored via chrome.storage.sync so your settings persist across devices where you are signed into
  Chrome.
  - AI model files — if you enable AI features and download the models, the model weights (ONNX files) are
   cached in IndexedDB for offline use. These are machine learning model parameters, not personal data.
  - Model download progress — temporary progress state stored in chrome.storage.local during model
  downloads, cleared automatically.

  No browsing history, page content, extracted results, or personally identifiable information is ever
  written to storage.

  AI Features

  The extension includes optional AI-powered features (name classification and named entity recognition)
  that use machine learning models from Hugging Face. These models are downloaded once and cached locally.
   All inference runs on your device using WebAssembly (ONNX Runtime). No page content or extracted data
  is sent to Hugging Face, Anthropic, Google, or any other external service.

  Permissions

  The extension requests browser permissions solely to perform its core functions: reading tab content for
   extraction, writing to the clipboard when you copy results, and creating an offscreen document to run
  AI models. A full explanation of each permission and why it is needed is available on the Chrome Web
  Store listing.

  Third Parties

  The extension does not share any data with third parties. There are no ads, analytics, tracking pixels,
  or external network requests other than the one-time AI model download from Hugging Face (which only
  transfers model weight files, not user data).

  Children's Privacy

  The extension does not knowingly collect any information from anyone, including children under 13.

  Changes to This Policy

  If this privacy policy is updated, the revised version will be posted at this URL with an updated date.
  Since the extension collects no data, changes are unlikely.
